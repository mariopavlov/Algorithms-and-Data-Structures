# Algorithms and Data Structures


## Repository Structure

- **zz_Archive** - when I start solving again a problem, I can archive the previous solution so that 
I can easily track my future progress and iterations;
- **zz_Templates** - will hold ready to use basic templates for various problems and projects. 
When I need to re-solve the problem or project I can start from some basic template with 
problem defined, rather than setting up all;
